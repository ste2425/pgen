This is Pgen 1.51.s with a new look and modified to work on a ps2 compatible ps3.

The new ps3 look and music was done by Samson from ps3hax.

the modifications for the ps3 were done by me, aries2k

This version doesn´t support hdd saving. I had to deactivate the hdd modules for the elf 
to load. All references to naplink were removed.
The SifIopReset sequence was removed and replaced with the one from 
uLaunch.elf by E.P and dlanor.
All necessary .Irx modules have been embedded in the elf.
The Irx module are all 100% homebrew from the ps2 homebrew sdk. :)
No copyrighted Sony ps2 bios modules are used. 

the music used was
