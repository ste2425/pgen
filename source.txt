I've got no time to work on PGEN anymore, so I figured it would be a good idea 
to release the source code :) Hopefully somebody else will pick up where I 
have left off and continue to improve and update PGEN.

The source code relies on the ps2sdk from www.ps2dev.org.

Additionally you need the following tools:
- zip

You can get the usb driver from the ps2sdk.

Well, Enjoy :)
